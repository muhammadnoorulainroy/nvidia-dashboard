Specifically, I will provide two tables: one listing winners by year, category, and birth date, and another defining mid-20th century (1950–1979) and late-20th/early-21st century (1980–2020) periods. First, calculate each winner’s age at the time of their win, then join this data with the temporal periods table, and finally, compute the average age of winners in each era. Based on this analysis, I want you to critique whether there has been a significant shift in the age profile of honorees over time, considering broader cultural trends in Hollywood’s recognition of younger versus older actors.",

I also need guidance on validating the results through cross-referencing with NOAA ground weather stations and visualizing the findings in an interactive map using Folium.
