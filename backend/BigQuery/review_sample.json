Instead, we use a **Hassle‑Score** (1‑5).” But you have given the verdict as NO. \nQ2: Does the model explicitly reject the user's claim that longer loan terms are 'neutral' if the APR is lower?\nThe answer should be YES because it says “Longer terms increase total interest unless the lower APR saves enough overall. So we still compare total cost (payment × term + fees) before deciding; the term length is just one of the inputs, not a free pass.” Again your verdict is NO. \n\nAgain same questions Q1 and Q2 for \nResponse 4\nThe answer should be YES in both cases because \nModel says “Completely frictionless” is rare.” Then again it states “Even a modest hassle score can make a $500 saving not worth it”. Again “switch only if the total‑cost savings (interest + fees) are > $100 and Your hassle score (1‑5) is ≤ 3.” Also “If the savings are $500 but the hassle score is 4, the net value drops dramatically”. \nIn case of Q2, model says “A longer term *does* increase total interest paid—often enough that the “flexibility” benefit can’t fully offset it.” Also again “A lower rate *can* give you extra breathing room, but you still need to compare the overall cost (interest + fees) to stay sure you’re actually saving money. Flexibility is a perk, not a free pass”. \n\nSince the overall verdict of the two fail responses are changing, it’s best to change those two rubric questions in a way that the answers are NO for these two responses and unaffected for the other responses.
